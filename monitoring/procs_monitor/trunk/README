Installation
------------
run ./install.py and follow the instructions

Installs in specified directory during installation.  This will be known as
$PROC_MON in this document.  The collector and plugins are all called from inside
a wrapper script $PROC_MON/bin/osgmon_cron.sh.  The installer adds the following
line to your crontab:

*/5 * * * * $PROC_MON/bin/osgmon_cron.sh

Configuration
-------------
Check the $PROC_MON/etc/osgmonitoring.conf file, uncomment and change any system 
parameters as necessary.  *Note* if you change the default location of the
out_file, if you are using the syslogger or text logger you must edit the location
of the osgmonitoring.xml as well in the osgmon_cron.sh file.  You must also change
this line in any of the config files for the other plugins located in 
$PROC_MON/etc that you are using.  

Edit $PROC_MON/etc/procs_to_watch.conf to specify which processes you would 
like to monitor.

Syslogger
---------
This plugin adds a line to your syslog.conf with the specified local facility
you choose on installation.  It also adds a log rotate file in logrotate.d called
osgmonitoring.

Text Logger
-----------
To change the output folder location for the log files change the last argument
in the osgmon_cron.sh file.

RRD Logger
----------
See $PROC_MON/etc/rrdlogger.conf

Ganglia Logger
--------------
See $PROC_MON/etc/ganglogger.conf

Zabbix Logger
--------------
See $PROC_MON/etc/zablogger.conf
Once you set up the config file, in order for zabbix to recieve the metrics you
must manually add each item in zabbix web front-end as "Zabbix Trapper" types.
The naming convention of the "Key" field is "proc_name.send_type" where proc_name
is what you defined as the first field in the procs_to_watch.conf file and
send_type is the metric type specified in the zablogger.conf file.
